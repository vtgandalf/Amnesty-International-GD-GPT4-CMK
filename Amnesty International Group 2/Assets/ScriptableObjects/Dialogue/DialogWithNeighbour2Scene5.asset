    - This is really noble of you, it is a great responsibility to try to get the
      family back together.  Another thing i can tell you is that she used to cook
      for me in exchange for small payments but she really loves her son and she wants
      better education and future for him and she was really sad that she could not
      provide it for him or even a small present.

    - I can give you the address of the school of her son. It is highstreet 93. Maybe
      you can go there and ask for more in depth information about her son's life
      at the school and if he is having problems.
